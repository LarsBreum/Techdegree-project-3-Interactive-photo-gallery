# Techdegree-project-4-Interactive-photo-gallery
The 4th Techdegree project

In this project I was tasked with develeping a photogallery, based on some mockups provided by treehouse. The Gallery had to be mobile-first, responsive and feature a JavaScript/jQuery driven lightbox function and search function.

The purpose was to show and develop my new skills in JavaScript and jQuery.

The lightbox function is implemented with the plugin: lightbox:
